# All the News Fit to Scrape!
This is a news scraper and MongoDB-utilizing forum.

Deployed application can be found here: https://quiet-mountain-17610.herokuapp.com/articles

# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the functionality of web scraping and NoSQL databases like MongoDB by creating a web application that scrapes a news site and offers the ability to post comments to the site. 

# Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Express Handlebars
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Cheerio
- Morgan
- Axios

# Future Developments:
- In the future I would try to scrape content off of Geekwire.com (a personal favorite startup news site). I would also like to refine how the scraper displays the article once clicked on.
